# ERC20 Token Manager

This is a ReactJS application developed to interact with an ERC20 token contract on the Ethereum, Sepolia, Goerli and Binance Testnet blockchain. The application allows users to:

1. Display ERC20 Token Balance: Users can enter an Ethereum address, and the application will fetch and display the balance of the native token.

2. Transfer ERC20 Tokens: Users can specify a recipient's Ethereum address and the amount of tokens to transfer. The application will then initiate a transfer of the specified amount of tokens from the user's address to the recipient's address.
